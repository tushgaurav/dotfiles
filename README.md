Welcome to my dotfiles repository!

This directory is meant to be located in `~/.dotfiles`. Dotfiles (hidden files beginning with a dot, like `.bashrc`, `.gitconfig`, `.vimrc`) store configuration for your shell, editor, and other tools. Keeping them in version control makes it easy to sync setups across machines.

## What are dot files?

Dot files, also known as **hidden files**, are files on a Unix-based operating system that begin with a "." (dot) character. These files are typically used to store configuration information for various programs and are **hidden by default** in directory listings. Examples of common dot files include `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, and `.gitconfig`.
